        "This project is aimed to predict the closing stock prices of Yes Bank using various Machine Learning models. The process involved several key steps including data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Collection and Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "I began by collecting historical stock price data for Yes Bank. The dataset included features such as the opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume for each trading day. Additional derived features such as price change, daily range, year, and month were also included to enhance the predictive power of the models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data preprocessing steps involved handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. We used the `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn to standardize the feature values, ensuring that all features contributed equally to the model training process.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
        "\n",
        "EDA was performed to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. We visualized the stock price trends, distributions, and correlations between different features. This step provided valuable insights that guided the feature engineering process and informed the choice of models for prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Model Training and Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "We implemented and evaluated several Machine Learning models, including ARIMA, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor (SVR). Each model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), R-squared (R2), and Adjusted R-squared.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Random Forest Regressor\n",
        "\n",
        "The Random Forest Regressor, an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees, showed better performance with a good R2 score and low error rates. Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV further improved the model's performance slightly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### XGBoost Regressor\n",
        "\n",
        "The XGBoost Regressor, known for its efficiency and scalability, also performed well with good evaluation metrics. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV marginally improved the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Support Vector Regressor (SVR)\n",
        "\n",
        "The SVR model demonstrated the best performance among all the models, with the lowest error rates and the highest R2 score after hyperparameter tuning. This model was chosen as the final prediction model due to its superior performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Feature Importance\n",
        "\n",
        "To understand the importance of different features in the final SVR model, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP values provided insights into the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions, highlighting the most influential features.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Model Saving and Deployment\n",
        "\n",
        "The best-performing SVR model was saved using joblib for deployment purposes. We then loaded the saved model and performed a sanity check by predicting on a new set of unseen data. The model maintained its performance on unseen data, confirming its robustness and readiness for deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion and Future Work\n",
        "\n",
        "The SVR model's exceptional performance makes it an excellent choice for predicting Yes Bank's stock prices. This model can be deployed on a live server for real-time predictions, aiding investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, this project demonstrated the power of Machine Learning in stock price prediction and provided a solid foundation for future enhancements and real-world applications. Future work can focus on incorporating additional features, using advanced techniques like deep learning, and optimizing the deployment process for scalability and efficiency."

        "\n",
        "Yes Bank is a prominent financial institution in India, widely recognized in the banking sector. Since 2018, the bank has been under significant scrutiny due to a high-profile fraud case involving its former CEO, Rana Kapoor. This event has had a notable impact on the bank's stock prices, making it a compelling subject for financial analysis.\n",

We started with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's characteristics and identify any patterns or anomalies. We then preprocessed the data, including feature extraction, scaling, and handling missing values.\n",

        "1. **Random Forest Regressor**: The Random Forest model performed reasonably well, with a good R2 score and low error rates. Hyperparameter tuning slightly improved the performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **XGBoost Regressor**: The XGBoost model also performed well, with good evaluation metrics. Hyperparameter tuning improved the performance, although the improvement was marginal.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **SVR Model**: The SVR model showed the best performance after hyperparameter tuning, with the lowest MSE, MAE, and MAPE, and the highest R2 score. This model was chosen as the final prediction model.\n",

        "4. **Feature Importance**: Using SHAP, we analyzed the feature importance for the SVR model. The most important features were identified, which significantly contributed to the model's predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Model Saving and Deployment**: We saved the best-performing SVR model in a pickle file format and loaded it again to predict unseen data for a sanity check. The model performed equally well on the unseen data, confirming its robustness.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Final Thoughts:\n",
        "\n",
        "The SVR model's superior performance makes it an excellent choice for predicting Yes Bank's stock prices. This model can now be deployed on a live server for real-time predictions, aiding investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions. Future work can focus on further improving the model by incorporating additional features, using advanced techniques like deep learning, and optimizing the deployment process for scalability and efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
